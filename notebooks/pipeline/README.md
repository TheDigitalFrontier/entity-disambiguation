# Pipeline Guide

Our project organizes its pipeline into three distinct phases.

### Data Structuring

Notebooks starting with '1_' are part of data structuring and prepare our input datasets for use with congruence.

### Candidate Pool Generation

Notebooks starting with '2_' are different methods to generate candidates for each named entity within the same sentence.

### Congruent Disambiguation

Notebooks starting with '3_' are different methods to calculate congruence and combine it with prior probabilities from phase 2.

### Others

All other notebooks are useful for baseline or context.
